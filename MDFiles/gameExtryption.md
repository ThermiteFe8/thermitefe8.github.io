# Extryption

Created for GADIG's Gamejam - Jamfest Fall 2025. This is an escape room based on the prompt of "Mixed Signals" created with Douglas Hale. I did the art, music, and sound, and Douglas did the programming/design. This is my favorite jam game I've created yet. You can play the game on [itch!](https://deglis.itch.io/extryption)
