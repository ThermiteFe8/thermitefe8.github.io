# Ferm's Freezeframe Frenzy. 

This game was created for the Virginia Collegiate Gamejam 2025. The prompt was "Hold it!". I created all of the art, animations, and music for this game. We won #1 in the Visuals category and #3 in the audio category. You can play this game on [itch](https://vernalumbrella.itch.io/ferms-freezeframe-frenzy).
